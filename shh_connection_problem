 step 1 :  Idle Timeout
Cause: The server or client is configured to disconnect idle SSH sessions after a specific duration.
Solution:
On the Client Side: Add keep-alive options in your local SSH configuration file (~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config):
    Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
   after this type sudo systemctl restart sshd

step2:  
 Too Many Simultaneous Connections
Cause: Exceeding the maximum allowed SSH connections on the server.
Solution:
Check and increase the limit in the server's SSH configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config):
   MaxSessions 10
   MaxStartups 10:30:60
   after this type sudo systemctl restart sshd
